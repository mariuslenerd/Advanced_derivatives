# Advanced derivatives
Repository to store and update all the work done in the advanced derivatives class. Financial Engineering 2nd year master students. 

We will be given assignments throughout the semester which will be handed out to the professor Ms. Elena Perazzi. 

The assignments are done in groups of three. 

For now, only assignment 1 is published as we have not received the other ones.
